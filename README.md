### 

Hello! 👋 I'm Mert Kadir Kayan, a passionate Front-End Developer based in Turkiye.


I’m a Frontend Developer with 3+ years of experience building scalable, high-performance web applications using Vue.js, Nuxt.js, React.js, Next.js and TypeScript, and JavaScript. My career spans international teams in Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland, where I contributed to enterprise fintech products, admin dashboards, and e-commerce platforms.

I specialize in:
 • Frontend architecture & clean UI with Vue/Nuxt and React/Next
 • End-to-end testing with Cypress
 • CI/CD workflows using GitLab, Docker, Rancher, Kubernetes
 • Agile collaboration with cross-functional teams

With a strong foundation in computer engineering and a passion for modern web development, I’m currently open to remote or hybrid Frontend Developer roles where I can deliver clean, maintainable code and contribute to team success.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to engaging with like-minded professionals!
