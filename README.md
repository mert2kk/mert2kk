### 

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mert Kadir Kayan, a passionate Front-End Developer based in Turkiye.


Iâ€™m a Frontend Developer with 3+ years of experience building scalable, high-performance web applications using Vue.js, Nuxt.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript. My career spans international teams in Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland, where I contributed to enterprise fintech products, admin dashboards, and e-commerce platforms.

I specialize in:
 â€¢ Frontend architecture & clean UI with Vue/Nuxt
 â€¢ End-to-end testing with Cypress
 â€¢ CI/CD workflows using GitLab, Docker, Rancher, Kubernetes
 â€¢ Agile collaboration with cross-functional teams

With a strong foundation in computer engineering and a passion for modern web development, Iâ€™m currently open to remote or hybrid Frontend Developer roles where I can deliver clean, maintainable code and contribute to team success.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to engaging with like-minded professionals!
