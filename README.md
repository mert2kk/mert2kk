### Hi there 👋

Hello! 👋 I'm Mert Kadir Kayan, a passionate Front-End Developer based in Turkiye.

💻 My expertise includes JavaScript, Vue.js and TypeScript, and I'm always eager to learn and grow in the ever-evolving field of technology.

🌐 I've had the privilege of broadening my horizons through experiences like the Erasmus program in Poland, where I delved into web development, Python, and e-commerce. I also recently completed an enriching Erasmus internship in Amsterdam, where I honed my skills in Vue.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Tailwind CSS, and more.

🌱 Currently mastering Full Stack development with a focus on JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue.js. Eager to contribute to both front-end and back-end solutions.
